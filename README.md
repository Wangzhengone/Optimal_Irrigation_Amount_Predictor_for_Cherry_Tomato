1.excel and 2.excel files are respectively excel files of environmental data and corresponding irrigation amount of cherry tomatoes in the vegetative growth period and reproductive growth period of greenhouse cultivation. There are two linear, forest and LSTMGRUTRANSFORMER files, which correspond to the analysis and modeling of data in the two periods. The Linear.py file contains the modeling code of MLR, Ridge regression and SVM models, the Forest.py file contains the modeling code of RF and XGBoost models, and the LSTMGRUTRANSFORMER file contains the modeling code of LSTM, GRU and Transformer models. For different environmental parameter input combinations in different periods, users need to manually modify the corresponding file worksheets and input lines in the code to establish different models.
